#
# ripgrep has two flags related to colors:
#
#     --color controls when to use colors.
#     --colors controls which colors to use.
#
# The --color flag accepts one of the following possible values: never, auto,
# always or ansi. The auto value is the default and will cause ripgrep to only
# enable colors when it is printing to a terminal. But if you pipe ripgrep to a
# file or some other process, then it will suppress colors.
#
# The --colors flag is a bit more complicated. The general format is:
#
# --colors '{type}:{attribute}:{value}'
#
#     {type} should be one of path, line, column or match. Each of these
#     correspond to the four different types of things that ripgrep will add
#     color to in its output. Select the type whose color you want to change.
#     {attribute} should be one of fg, bg or style, corresponding to foreground
#     color, background color, or miscellaneous styling (such as whether to
#     bold the output or not). {value} is determined by the value of
#     {attribute}. If {attribute} is style, then {value} should be one of
#     nobold, bold, nointense, intense, nounderline or underline. If
#     {attribute} is fg or bg, then {value} should be a color.
#
# A color is specified by either one of eight of English names, a single
# 256-bit number or an RGB triple (with over 16 million possible values, or
# "true color").
#
# The color names are red, blue, green, cyan, magenta, yellow, white or black.
#
# A single 256-bit number is a value in the range 0-255 (inclusive). It can
# either be in decimal format (e.g., 62) or hexadecimal format (e.g., 0x3E).
#
# An RGB triple corresponds to three numbers (decimal or hexadecimal) separated
# by commas.
#
# As a special case, --colors '{type}:none' will clear all colors and styles
# associated with {type}, which lets you start with a clean slate (instead of
# building on top of ripgrep's default color settings).
#
# Here's an example that makes highlights the matches with a nice blue
# background with bolded white text:
#
# $ rg somepattern \
#     --colors 'match:none' \
#     --colors 'match:bg:0x33,0x66,0xFF' \
#     --colors 'match:fg:white' \
#     --colors 'match:style:bold'
#
# Colors are an ideal candidate to set in your configuration file. See the
# question on emulating The Silver Searcher's output style for an example
# specific to colors.
#
# Use the --colors flag, like so:
#
# rg --colors line:fg:yellow      \
#    --colors line:style:bold     \
#    --colors path:fg:green       \
#    --colors path:style:bold     \
#    --colors match:fg:black      \
#    --colors match:bg:yellow     \
#    --colors match:style:nobold  \
#    foo

--colors=path:fg:cyan
--colors=match:fg:yellow
